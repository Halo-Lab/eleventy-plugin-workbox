# [1.1.1] - 2021-04-01

### Added

- [TypeScript's definiton files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-d-ts.html).

### Changed

- Time log from custom format to default locale based one.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-03-31

This release has not any changes. The reason of it is [unpublished version of package with such name had made two years ago](https://registry.npmjs.org/eleventy-plugin-workbox). [NPM does not allow to republish package with same version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-unpublish#description), so we just rewrite release version.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-03-30

### Added

- Automatic injection of service worker registration in HTML.
- Generation of service worker based on builded assets by Eleventy.
